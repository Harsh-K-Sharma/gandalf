\section{Overview of code}
\CODENAME is a new SPH code written in C++ and python based partly on the algorithms and code structures used in SEREN (Hubber et al. 2011), but principally written from scratch.  It has been written for several purposes.
\begin{itemize}
\item \CODENAME can be written in three different modes; as a standard executable run from the command line (like SEREN), run from a python script or run inside an interactive python environment.  Both the script and interactive python modes include a graphical output that can be used to visualise previously run simulations, or to interactively visualise simulations as they are run.
\item \CODENAME generates initial conditions at run-time, as opposed to SEREN where the initial conditions had to be prepared a priori.
\item \CODENAME uses additional parameters to switch on various physics options, as well as requiring them to be activated in the Makefile.  In comparison, SEREN controlled physics options exclusively in the Makefile.
\item \CODENAME uses modules to contain all subroutines.  Therefore, no additional interface file (such as interface.F90) exists in SEREN\_VIEW.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installation} \label{S:INSTALL}
Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item C++ compiler; at present, only gcc/g++ has been tested with the code
\item Python 2.7
\item matplotlib compatible with python 2.7
\item swig compatible with python 2.7
\item f2py compatible with python 2.7
%\item ffmpeg (for generating movies automatically)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Linux}
All of these programs/libraries can be found in most standard Linux installations, and if not, will be present in package managers.


\subsection{Mac OS X}
All programs can be installed with either fink, MacPorts or homebrew.  It is preferable that all (except the Fortran compiler) are downloaded with just the one package manager in order to ensure they are compatible and function together correctly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Makefile options}
The \CODENAME Makefile is used to select options which are used to compile the code with.  If the user wishes to change any compile-time options, the code must be recompiled from scratch by typing {\var make clean}, and {\var make seren} or \var{make seren\_view}.  For users of SEREN, the \CODENAME Makefile is somewhat simpler with many options either not present (since more complex algorithms have not been implemented) or have been transfered to the parameters file.  This has been done in order to make it less likely that the wrong Makefile options are used in simulations, and also to stop the need to recompile the code completely so often when using slightly different options.

\section{Basic usage}
\CODENAME can be run in three principle modes.  Command-line mode, where the code is run via the command line with a parameters file (similar to SEREN), via a python script where the code is run in a python environment with various plotting options available as well as running the code, and in interactive mode where all the code and plotting options can be run directly in a python shell.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Set-up}

If you wish to run \CODENAME only as a C++ executable from the command line without visualisation, then it is possible to compile only the C++ code, ignoring all python libraries, by typing 
\newline
\noindent \var{make executable} \\


If you wish to compile all python components of the code, then you must first complete the following steps : 
\begin{itemize}

\item Install all python-related programs listed in Section \ref{S:INSTALL}

\item Add the location of the main \CODENAME directory to the \var{PYTHONPATH} environment variable.  If you are using bash or related shells, then add 
\newline
\noindent \var{export PYTHONPATH=XXX/YYY/ZZZ:\$PYTHONPATH} \\

to your bashrc (or bash\_profile) script where {\var XXX/YYY/ZZZ} is the absolute path of the \CODENAME directory.  

If you are using csh, tcsh or related shells, then add
\newline
\noindent \var{setenv PYTHONPATH ``XXX/YYY/ZZZ:\$PYTHONPATH''} \\

\item Set the required version of python and f2py in your Makefile.  Since operating systems usually have more than one version of python installed, it is important to ensure that make uses the correct version when compiling the code.  These are set by the \var{PYTHON} and \var{F2PY} variables in the Makefile.

Also, make requires the location of the python and numpy libraries.  In most cases, make will be able to locate these libraries automatically.  However, if there is a problem, or you wish to use an alternative version of these libraries installed elsewhere on your system, then these can be set by the \var{PYLIB} and \var{NUMPY} variables in the Makefile.  


\item To compile all components of the code, including the python libraries with swig, type : \\
\newline
\noindent \var{make} or \var{make all} \\

\end{itemize}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Command-line mode}

\noindent To run a simulation the C++ executable, type : \\
\newline
\var{./seren PARAMSFILE} \\
\newline
where PARAMSFILE is the name of the params file for that simulation.  If the parameters file does not exist, or contains invalid parameter options, then the program will quit citing an error message.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interactive mode}

To compile all components the advance interactive visualisation version of the code, type :\\
\newline
\noindent \var{make} or \var{make all} \\

\noindent To open the interactive viewer, type : \\
\newline
\var{python seren\_view.py} \\
\newline
or, depending on the default version of python on your system (e.g. installing matplotlib with fink on Mac OS X), \\
\newline
\var{python2.7 seren\_view.py} \\
\newline
\noindent The code should open with a splash screen containing the code title followed by a command prompt of the form '\var{seren\_view >'}'.  To run a simulation defined by a parameter file, then type \\
\newline
\var{newsim PARAMSFILE} \\
\newline
\noindent and then \\
\newline
\var{run} \\
\newline
\noindent The current simulation can be plotted at any point by using simple commands such as, for example, \\
\newline
\var{plot sph x y} \\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Generating initial conditions}

One important difference between SEREN and SEREN\_VIEW is that initial conditions can be generated on-the-fly in SEREN\_VIEW, i.e. while running the code, unlike SEREN where initial conditions always had to be generated before the simulation.  While they are still situations where it is appropriate to prepare initial conditions prior to running the simulations, it is more convenient to generate the initial conditions at the same time as running the simulation.

At present, the following initial conditions are included in the code : 

\noindent SPH simulations : \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
- khi       &: Kelvin-helmholtz instability \\
- randcube  &: Random cube of gas particles \\
- rti       &: Rayleigh-Taylor instability \\
- sedov     &: Sedov blastwave test \\
- shocktube &: Simple two-fluid shocktube test \\
- plummer   &: Plummer sphere (stars + gas, or just gas)
\end{tabular}
\newline

\noindent N-body simultions : \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
- binary    &: Simple circular binary test \\
- burrau    &: Burrau Pythagorean test \\
- figure8   &: Simple 3-body figure-8 test \\
- plummer   &: Plummer sphere (stars + gas, or just stars) \\
- quadruple &: Simple hierarchical quadruple test
\end{tabular}

\section{Python viewer usage}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Python viewer commands}

Information on commands for the python viewer is available using the 'help' command.  Typing 'help' or 'h' gives a list of all the principle commands available.  Typing 'help command' or 'h command' gives more information on the chosen command.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Python viewer script examples}

The python viewer can read in scripts to perform some repetitive sequence of viewing commands.  Any script can be read in and processed by typing : 
\var{read SCRIPTNAME}. \\
\newline

\noindent Example 1 - Loading a snapshot and plotting SPH quantites : \\

\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}p{6cm}}

\var{loadsim su BBSIT2} &              (Load in second simulation files) \\
\var{sim 1} &                          (Select first simulation) \\
\var{snap 200} &                       (Select 200th snapshot) \\
\var{plot star x y color=red legend=1 plotstyle=tracks} & (..) \\
\var{sim 2} &                          (..) \\
\var{snap 200} &                       (..) \\
\var{addplot star x y color=blue legend=1 plotstyle=tracks linestyle=--} & (..) \\

\section{To-do list}

\subsection{Known bugs}
\begin{itemize}
\item ...
%\item If running a simulation in interactive mode, the simulation variables can become corrupted if previous snapshots are viewed, i.e. once a previous snapshot is viewed, the simulation can no longer be continued.
%\item If running a simulation in interactive mode and a different simulation is loaded into memory, then it is no longer possible to continue running that simulation.
%\item Rendered images are technically not done correct if smoothing lengths are smaller than the grid size (which can often be the case, although the images are fine for viewing/movie purposes).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Proposed features}
List of possible new features, in list of decreasing order of probable implementation.
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot star/sink-based statistics, e.g. sink mass-functions, binary statistics
\item More sanity-checking/error-trapping (to prevent crashing on erroneous input)
\end{itemize}
