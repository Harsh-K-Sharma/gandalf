class PlottingProcess (Process):
    '''Contains the code for the plotting process.  The run method is the main
    method that gets executed. It contains an infinite loop, where the command
    queue is inspected;  if there are commands on it, they get executed.
    The method also does some bookkeeping, removing closed figures.
    After that, it pauses for a while until the queue is inspected again.
    The only way to exit from this loop is to get a 'STOP' string on the
    command queue.  The class contains also a couple of helper functions, and
    many structures to do the bookkeeping of figures, limits, quantities, ...
    (see the comments in the constructor).
